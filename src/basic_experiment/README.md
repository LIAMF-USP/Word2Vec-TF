# Basic Experiment

This folder contains scripts to compare the perfomance of two implementations of the word2vec model: the one from gensim and the other from the tensorflow model repository.


- **Experiment1** : We train both models with different **embedding sizes** using a portuguese corpus.

- **Experiment2** : We train both models with different **embedding sizes** using an english corpus.

- **Experiment3** : We train both models with different **embedding sizes** using a portuguese corpus, now we apply a preprocessing function to this corpus.

- **Experiment4** : We train both models with different **embedding sizes** using an english corpus, now we apply a preprocessing function to this corpus.

- **Experiment5** : We train both models with different **window sizes** using a portuguese corpus.

- **Experiment6** : We train both models with different **window sizes** using an english corpus.

- **Experiment7** :  We train both models with different **window sizes** using a portuguese corpus, now we apply a preprocessing function to this corpus.

- **Experiment8** : We train both models with different **window sizes** using an english corpus, now we apply a preprocessing function to this corpus.
